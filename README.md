Secret Santa Application!

Description: To everyone who are unfamiliar with the term 'Secret Santa': This tradition refers to giving at a random person a gift during christmas period. The receiver won't know the name of its gifter (hence the name Secret Santa!) until he/she receive from him/her! The nature of what anyone receive is rather symbolic, not particularly expensive and should aim to what the receiver loves (eg. hobbies, tv series, pets etc etc.). The tradition is split in two different parts: Put your name in a bowl and pick from it to see whose person will get your present and the exchange of gifts which is kinda self-explanatory.

For the sake of this application, let me propose that this application works in two different .py's:

 The first let anyone update their preferences in a .db file called ('users'), which will be used in the second .py . The best part of it is that you can add names and preferences, update those values or delete them! I find it particulary usefull in a corporate setting where someone doesn't want to partecipate, someone else joins the team or wants somewhat specific gifts. 

 The second part is quite straightforward and let us pair up the Secret Santa with its beneficiary!

 To get technical lets explain which file does what:
